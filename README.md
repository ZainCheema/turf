# "Turf" (Work In Progress)

Gif here

"Turf" is an app I am currently making to gain an understanding of what is needed from an Android Engineer in 2021. The app currently has the following:

. Written in Kotlin, uses MVVM with Repository architecture
. UI is state-driven using LiveData and Jetpack Compose
. Retrofit, Moshi and RxJava used for Network Querying and Streaming
. Dependency Injection using Dagger Hilt

I wrote a RESTFul Web Service for the app, which was made using Python, and stores data via a MongoDB cluster. Source code for that can also be found on my Github. The service is hosted by Google CLoud Platform

What I am working on within the app can be seen by clicking on the "Projects" tab on the repository.

Currently working on:

. UI and UX polishing
. Unit Tests with JUnit and Espresso
